> ### Kotlin + Spring codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with Kotlin + Spring including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the Kotlin + Spring community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
